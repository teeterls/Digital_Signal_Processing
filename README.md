# Digital_Signal_Processing
Basic Digital Signal Processing codes in Matlab. In this repo, several DSP projects can be found in different folders, each one including the executable file-m) (main and every extra file needed (audio files .WAV or data container files .mat)
The structure and content of this repo is the following:

### 1. Sampling and quantation
      
   sdfsghg
      
### 2. Uniform and non-uniform quantitation

      dxfdgnh 
### 3. Changing the sampling rate

### 4. Digital FIR filters
### 5. Digital IIR filters

### 6. Effects of finite precision on the design of digital filters

### 7. Implementation of LTI filters using DFT

### 8. Adaptive filtering using the LMS algorithms
