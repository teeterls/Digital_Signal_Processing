# Digital_Signal_Processing

Basic Digital Signal Processing codes in Matlab. In this repo, several DSP projects can be found in different folders, each one including the executable file-m) (main and every extra file needed (audio files .WAV or data container files .mat)
The structure and content of this repo is the following:

### 1. Sampling and quantation

  Basic concepts of sampling and quantification of continuous signals. For this purpose, the following           data are provided in a .mat file:
  - The amplitude of a signal x(t) (vector x) sampled as a function of time (vector t)
  - The amplitude of a  signal k(t) (vector k) sampled as a function of time (vector t_k) 
      
### 2. Uniform and non-uniform quantitation

 The quantification process is necessary in the transition from continuous signals to discrete signals in finite-precision systems.
finite-precision systems, which allows the signals to be stored, transmitted or processed digitally.
digital form. In this practice we are going to work with two types of quantization (uniform and non-uniform) and analyze the results obtained from the application of two types of quantization.
and non-uniform) and to analyze the results obtained by applying each of them to the same signal.
For this purpose, an audio file is provided.
